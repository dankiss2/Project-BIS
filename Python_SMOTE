## Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, SMOTE. Requires pre_smote_processed_data.xlsx. from previous Python script.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the preprocessed dataset
file_path = "pre_smote_processed_data.xlsx"
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Define the features and target variable
X = df.drop('Churned in 2022?', axis=1)
y = df['Churned in 2022?']

# Split the dataset into train and test sets using stratified sampling
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE to the train dataset
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_smote, y_train_smote = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Save the train set with SMOTE applied to an xlsx file
train_set = pd.concat([X_train_smote, y_train_smote], axis=1)
train_set.to_excel("BIS_train_smote.xlsx", index=False)

# Save the test set to an xlsx file
test_set = pd.concat([X_test, y_test], axis=1)
test_set.to_excel("BIS_test.xlsx", index=False)

print("Lock, Stock, and two smoking hot SMOTE sets completed.")
